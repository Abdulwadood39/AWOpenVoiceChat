# TODO

[Silero](https://github.com/snakers4/silero-models) seems to work fast on cpu and has a lot of control over tts.

There should be a better way to import different things from stt and tts etc.

We don't have a good visualizer. And other UI is good.

Tortoise needs to be implemented properly.

Good demo videos showing interruptions and response time etc.

OpenAI GPT API support

Streaming everything (stt, tts, llm), if it'll help latency

Web interface/API. Two websockets, audio in and audio out.

Make it a pip package

Integrations with popular LLM packages and software

Turn Taking model? Retell seems to be doing it.
