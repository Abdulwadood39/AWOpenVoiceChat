The tts sounds very clean. There is a delay before the
response. Probably just making sure that the person is done 
speaking. Also, if the LLM output is computed before, this 
may also be a reason for the delay. 
They didn't show any interruptions.
They say it is for standard use cases, the chatbot could just
be a RASA bot.

The tts is not that great. They're probably using 
vits, the voice dies down at the end. The response time
is alright. They support interruptions. The chatbot is 
an LLM.
